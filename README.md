This is the simple shell practise/trials repo.

I will be working from here, all the files will be available to both you and I.

I have come across a test suite repo (checker), will add it here in a few.

After we are done. I will the be easily to mv the files to the main shell repos and push from both ends.

Good luck to us mate!
